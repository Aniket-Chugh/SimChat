Audio message
↓
Speech-to-text processing
↓
Text stored in message system


---

# 2. AI System Features

The platform includes a modular AI system that enables multiple intelligent capabilities.

## AI Capabilities

### Conversation Summarization

Summarizes long chat threads into concise insights.

Example output:


Meeting Summary:
• Backend API pending
• UI design approved
• Deadline Monday


---

### Smart Reply Generation

AI suggests possible responses based on conversation context.

Example suggestions:


Yes, that works.
Let's schedule it tomorrow.
I'll review the document.


---

### Semantic Search

Messages are converted into embeddings for intelligent search.

Example:


"file Rahul shared"


The system retrieves semantically related messages.

---

### Task Extraction

AI identifies tasks automatically from conversation text.

---

# 3. Unique Selling Points (USP)

The system introduces several advanced capabilities that differentiate it from a basic chat application.

## AI Collaboration Assistant

AI acts as an assistant that can:

- summarize discussions
- generate replies
- extract tasks
- provide insights

---

## Intelligent Search

Unlike traditional chat systems, this platform supports **semantic search**.

Users can find information even without exact keywords.

---

## AI Task Automation

Tasks are automatically detected and created from conversations.

This improves productivity for teams.

---

## Modular AI Engine

The AI system supports multiple model providers:


OpenAI
Local LLM
Speech-to-text models


This makes the architecture flexible and future-proof.

---

## Scalable Microservice-Ready Design

The backend architecture is designed to easily transition into microservices.

Each module can run independently.

---

# 4. Non-Functional Requirements

## 4.1 Scalability

The system must handle thousands of concurrent users.

Design decisions:

- Redis caching
- queue workers
- horizontal scaling

---

## 4.2 Performance
